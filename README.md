# Revised
A Google Sheets addon that places the last revision date in the lower right hand corner.

## Tips
If the revision date is not getting put where you think it should, try putting a space or some other content somewhere in the row you want the date to be placed. Sheets considers the "last" row to be the "last row with content".
